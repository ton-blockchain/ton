@stderr can not assign `address` to variable of type `slice`
@stderr hint: unlike FunC, Tolk has a special type `address` (which is slice at the TVM level);
@stderr most likely, you just need `address` everywhere
@stderr hint: alternatively, use `as` operator for unsafe casting: `<some_expr> as slice`
