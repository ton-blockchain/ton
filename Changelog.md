## 2024.04 Update

1. Emulator: Single call optimized runGetMethod added
2. Tonlib: a series of proof improvements, also breaking Change in `liteServer.getAllShardsInfo` method (see below)
3. DB: usage statistics now collected, outdated persistent states are not serialized
4. LS: fast `getOutMsgQueueSizes` added, preliminary support of non-final block requests
5. Network: lz4 compression of block candidates (disabled by default).
6. Overlays: add custom overlays
7. Transaction Executor: fixed issue with due_payment collection

* `liteServer.getAllShardsInfo` method was updated for better efficiency. Previously, field proof contained BoC with two roots: one for BlockState from block's root and another for ShardHashes from BlockState. Now, it returns a single-root proof BoC, specifically the merkle proof of ShardHashes directly from the block's root, streamlining data access and integrity. Checking of the proof requires to check that ShardHashes in the `data` correspond to ShardHashes from the block.

Besides the work of the core team, this update is based on the efforts of @akifoq (due_payment issue).

## 2024.03 Update

   * `--archive-preload-period` option
4. Preparatory (not enabled yet) code for addition on new TVM instructions for cheaper fee calculation onchain.

## 2024.01 Update

1. Fixes in how gas in transactions on special accounts is accounted in block limit. Previously, gas was counted as usual, so to conduct elections that costs >30m gas block limit in masterchain was set to 37m gas. To lower the limit for safety reasons it is proposed to caunt gas on special accounts separately. Besides `gas_max` is set to `special_gas_limit` for all types of transactions on special accounts. New behavior is activated through setting `version >= 5` in `ConfigParam 8;`.
   * Besides update of config temporally increases gas limit on `EQD_v9j1rlsuHHw2FIhcsCFFSD367ldfDdCKcsNmNpIRzUlu` to `special_gas_limit`, see [details](https://t.me/tonstatus/88).
2. Improvements in LS behavior
   * Improved detection of the state with all shards applied to decrease rate of `Block is not applied` error
   * Better error logs: `block not in db` and `block is not applied` separation
   * Fix error in proof generation for blocks after merge
   * Fix most of `block is not applied` issues related to sending too recent block in Proofs
   * LS now check external messages till `accept_message` (`set_gas`).
3. Improvements in DHT work and storage, CellDb, config.json amendment, peer misbehavior detection, validator session stats collection, emulator.
4. Change in CTOS and XLOAD behavior activated through setting `version >= 5` in `ConfigParam 8;`:
   * Loading "nested libraries" (i.e. a library cell that points to another library cell) throws an exception.
   * Loading a library consumes gas for cell load only once (for the library cell), not twice (both for the library cell and the cell in the library).
   * `XLOAD` now works differently. When it takes a library cell, it returns the cell that it points to. This allows loading "nested libraries", if needed.

Besides the work of the Core team, this update is based on the efforts of @XaBbl4 (peer misbehavior detection) and @akifoq (CTOS behavior and gas limit scheme for special accounts).

## 2023.12 Update

1. Optimized message queue handling, now queue cleaning speed doesn't depend on total queue size
     * Cleaning delivered messages using lt augmentation instead of random search / consecutive walk
     * Keeping root cell of queue message in memory until outdated (caching)
2. Changes to block collation/validation limits
3. Stop accepting new external message if message queue is overloaded
4. Introducing conditions for shard split/merge based on queue size

Read [more](https://blog.ton.org/technical-report-december-5-inscriptions-launch-on-ton) on that update.

4. Changes to public libraries: now contract can not publish more than 256 libraries (config parameter) and contracts can not be deployed with public libraries in initstate (instead contracts need explicitly publish all libraries)
5. Changes to storage due payment: now due payment is collected in Storage Phase, however for bouncable messages fee amount can not exceed balance of account prior to message.

* A series of FunC improvements, summarized [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/378)
#### Update delay
Update coincided with persistent state serialization event which lead to block production speed deterioration (issue substantially mitigated in update itself). This phenomena was aggravated by the fact that after update some validators lost ability to participate in block creation. The last was caused by threshold based hardcoded protocol version bump, where threshold was set in such manner (based on block height with value higher than 9m), that it eluded detection in private net tests. The update was temporarily paused and resumed after persistent state serialization ended and issues with block creation were resolved.

Besides the work of the core team, this update is based on the efforts of @awesome-doge (help with abseil-cpp upgrade), @rec00rsiff (noted issues for exotic endianess and implemented network stats) and third-party security auditors.

## 2022.05 Update
* Initial synchronization improved: adjusted timeouts for state download and the way of choosing which state to download. Nodes with low network speed and/or bad connectivity will synchronize faster and consistently.
* Improved peer-to-peer network stability and DDoS resistance: now peers will only relay valid messages to the network. Large messages, which require splitting for relaying, will be retranslated as well, but only after the node gets all parts, and reassembles and checks them. Validators may sign certificates for network peers, which allow relaying large messages by parts without checks. It is used now by validators to faster relay new blocks. Sign and import certificate commands are exposed via `validator-engine-console`.
* Fixed some rare edge cases in TVM arithmetic operations related to big numbers (`2**63+`)
* Improved fixes used to combat wrong activate-destruct-activate contract behavior last November.
* Improved tonlib: support libraries (with client-side caching), getmethods completely fill c7 register, getmethods support slice arguments, improved messages listing for transactions, added extended block header params, added getConfig method.
* RocksDB updated to a newer version.
* Improved persistent state serialization: memory usage during serialization was optimized; the start of serialization on different nodes was sparsed.
* FunC update: support for string literals and constants (including precompiled constant expressions), semver, `include` expressions.
* Fixed rarely manifested bugs in `Asm.fif`.
* LiteClient supports key as cli parameter.
* Improved Liteserver DoS resistance for running getmethods.

Besides the work of the core team, this update is based on the efforts of @tvorogme (added support for slice arguments and noted bugs in Asm.fif), @akifoq (fixed bug in Asm.fif), @cryshado (noted strange behavior of LS, which, upon inspection, turned out to be a vector of DoS attack).
