# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The TON blockchain node software follows a date-based versioning scheme (YYYY.MM). We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2025.12 | :white_check_mark: |
| 2025.11 | :white_check_mark: |
| 2025.10 | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2025.10 | :x:                |

We recommend always using the latest stable release to ensure you have the most recent security patches and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact our security team at **security@example.com** or use the private **"Report a vulnerability"** feature on our GitHub repository if available.

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within **3 business days**. You can expect follow‑up updates at least **once every 7 business days** while we investigate and work on a fix.

After receiving your report, we will:
- Confirm receipt and request any additional information we need.
- Triage and assess the impact and severity of the issue.
- Develop, test, and prepare a fix and any necessary mitigations.
- Coordinate a disclosure timeline with you, including when a fix will be released and when the issue can be publicly disclosed.

If we determine that the reported issue is not a security vulnerability or is out of scope, we will explain our reasoning. In all cases, we strive to keep you informed throughout the process.
