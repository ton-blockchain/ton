The TON blockchain node software follows a continuous deployment model. Security updates are applied to the **master branch**, which runs on the mainnet. 

We recommend always running the latest version from the master branch to ensure you have all security patches and updates. For testing purposes, the **testnet branch** contains upcoming updates that will be merged to master after thorough testing.

| Branch | Status | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| master | :white_check_mark: Actively supported | Production-ready code running on mainnet with security updates |
| testnet | :warning: Testing | Contains new updates being tested before mainnet deployment |
| older commits | :x: Not supported | Security updates are not backported to older versions |

For production deployments, we strongly recommend staying up-to-date with the master branch.
